# Snap-Shipper

This is a simple script to help you Ship those snapshots

This was made because i wanted a solution for automatically uploading my snapshots that didn't involve google drive or dropbox and as such this works right now, but if there is interest i would gladly try to make this more suitable for a wider audience.

## future plans

Add more sink types and add error handling and notifications
