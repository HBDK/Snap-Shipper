# Changelog

## 0.01

- Initial

## 0.0.1rc0

This version is identical to the last in all but the way the image is build.
Switching from 0.01 to this version might require you to uninstall the add-on and reinstall it (not just re-build).
The addons config will be lost when uninstalling so make sure to take a copy before you uninstall.

- use pre build image instead (the code is on [github](https://github.com/HBDK/Snap-Shipper-Docker))

## 0.0.1rc3

added 3s sinks and a done log messeage.
